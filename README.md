<h1>Setup</h1>
 This is meant to be deployed on heroku using a MongoDB Atlas database as the main method of storage for the server. However, this can be run locally by setting 

```
const uri = process.env.MONGODB_URI; 
``` 
to your Atlas login key. This is a good time to mention the setup process for Atlas. [This article](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/how-to/use-atlas-on-heroku/) from mongodb's website is the most informative resource for setting up the database and is how I initially setup the storage.
