Simple chat app using node, socket.io, and express. To use, type ``` node server.js ``` into the terminal and go to ``` localhost:3000 ```. Alternatively, this can be deployed fairly painlessly on heroku by linking a clone of this repo to your github. No changes are required if using heroku; simply travel to the specificed URL and the server will connect.
